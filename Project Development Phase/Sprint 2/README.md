# Details of actions performed in sprint 2

> This sprint contains project files from tasks performed as planned in project planning phase as,

- Email confirmation ( **verification**  as mentioned in the Email verification code (React) ).
- The email verification (account-confirmation) code is uploaded in this section.
- **Project image files** as it contains the image of email received after the success of account creation in the user sign up page and verification message after the account is verified.
- It contains sample datasets and images of parkinson's disease that is recorded in the past for analyzing it ahead of the project under the main folder as **Research disease files**.
- The main dataset for the project is uploaded as the separate main folder as **Project dataset**.


> Email verification code using react contains the code lines for performing the email verification after the user creates the account and for viewing the verification message after clicking the link from the verification email.

Researchimages-disease folder is created for to show the image files that we created during research and knowing the sample disease images of Parkinson. Also sample data that we found useful for comparing and analyzing it with the past results as majorly for learning more about the disease.

**From the project planning phase for Data checking as functional requirements, we spent some time in learning and understanding the data that we colleced. In the data,it contains vocal vibratory rate which determines the variation in waveshape of the voice signal from an person. Power level of the information signal changes of the amplitude of the voice or carrier signal as represented in the project dataset.**

> The data majorly contains the labels in terms of voice frequency which is very useful in predicting the disease as in accordance with the symptoms of parkinson's disease.
